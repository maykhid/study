         traverse string, for each letter 'item', minus the ord('item') from the ord('a'). This trick is actually really beautifulðŸ¥°.
         we know ord('a') is 97 (ascii), so lets say the item is b the ascii of b is 98, when subtracted we have 1, so we increment the value of the element 
         at index 1 by one. 

         so basically we use this as a record keeper for char we've seen before. so at the end of the day we check if both records dic1 and dic2 are equal. 
         if equal it means its a valid anagram.

        return dic1 == dic2
